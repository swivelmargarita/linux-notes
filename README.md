## Description 

Sometimes remembering exact syntax or options of a command or tool. 
This is an effort to compile that information into central repository. For example:  
- You know that `find` can execute commmands on found files, but forgot the syntax?  
Was it `-exec <command> {};` or `-exec <command> {}\;`?  
Was there a space?  
- Or that handy `rsync` option?
- How did I suppose to redirect both output and error into?  
`2&1>` or `2>&1`?
